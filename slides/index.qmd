## Ranking

Using comparison information, e.g.

- pairwise win/loss/draw (competing 1v1) or
- group orderings ($k$ competing players),

how can we estimate the *rating* of each individual?

## Comparisons have a network/hypergraph structure

- Vertex = players
- (hyper)edge = match

$\implies$ there are multiedges and multihyperedges.

## Bayesian model

For win/loss/draw:

- Player's rating $R_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$
- Effective rating: $S_i\sim \mathcal{N}(R_i, 1)$ and
- The outcome of a match between $i$ and $j$ is determined based on $Z_{ij}=S_i-S_j$:
    $$\text{outcome of $i$ vs $j$ } = \begin{cases}
        \text{draw} & \text{if } |Z_{ij}| < t,\\
        i \text{ wins} & \text{if } Z_{ij} > t,\\
        j \text{ wins} & \text{if } Z_{ij} < t.
    \end{cases}
    $$
- Draw threshold: $t \sim \text{Exp}(1/2)$.

For group orderings:

- Player's rating $R_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.
- Effective rating $S_i\sim \mathcal{N}(R_i, 1)$.
- The result of a match between $i$ and $j$ is determined based the order of effective scores
    $$\text{outcome of } (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k) = \text{order of } (S_1, S_2, \dots, S_k),
    $$


## Main question

Does the competition structure have an influence on the quality of rankings?

e.g.

- Rating assortativity --- matches involve similar ratings
- Degree sequence (is there correlation between degree and rating?)

. . .

Problem: rating assortativity naturally biases the degree sequence.

## Comparing rankings to Spring-rank

## Future (?) of the project

- Bias edge probabilities using ratings, see if it helps inference
- Answer our initial question about the impact of the network structure
